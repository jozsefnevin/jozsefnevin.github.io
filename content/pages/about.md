I am a software engineer living in Chicago. I graduated from Univeristy of Iowa in 2013 and have work across multple industries from electronics to fintech. I am interested in all aspects of software engineering from Angular to .NET and Docker to Azure DevOps. When I'm not developing, I'm at the movies, reading, or playing video/board games.
